There is an emphasis on doctors bringing their skills and lifesaving supplies to the people of Gaza.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(111, 114, 135);">During the October 2023 war, Glia Gaza immediately distributed its full inventory of over 1000 tourniquets to first responders and hospitals that were treating casualties of shellings and bombings. At the time of this publication, this war is ongoing and the number of injured and dead continues to rise. On October 10, Glia’s offices were heavily damaged as a result of a nearby bombing, making it nearly impossible to manufacture any more tourniquets in this facility for the foreseeable future. Glia has an ongoing campaign to ensure Gaza is adequately stocked with tourniquets, as part of its broader Stop the Bleed: Gaza initiative, which also provides training on the proper use and application of tourniquets.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(111, 114, 135);">Islamic Relief Canada</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(111, 114, 135);">We have once again partnered with Islamic Relief Canada to procure food, hygiene supplies, bedding, and any other essential item that can be sourced. They screen and contract local suppliers and partners, who procure either locally or through private trading routes between Gaza and Egypt.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(111, 114, 135);">Islamic Relief has successfully facilitated aid trucks entering Gaza through the Egypt border crossing, which has helped to alleviate some of the pressure on the ground. We are also actively exploring additional avenues of aid through various border crossings. Working alongside local partners and the World Food Programme, we are presently active in the Middle Area including Deir Al Balah, Zawayda, and Al Nusairat, as well Khan Younis and Rafah.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(111, 114, 135);">Empowering Education Through CPPF (OMAR BARZAK SCHOLARSHIP):</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(111, 114, 135);">Our collaboration with the Canadian Palestinian Professional Foundation (CPPF) focuses on nurturing academic excellence and leadership in Palestine. Through scholarship funding and support, we are shaping the future generation by enabling them to pursue education and professional growth. Join us in fostering brighter prospects for these talented students.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(111, 114, 135);">Enhancing Neonatal Care in London:</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(111, 114, 135);">Babies in the NICU require constant monitoring and precise control of their environment, down to the degree, as well as frequent testing to prioritize their constant medical needs and complications. In order to ensure that NICU babies – who often weigh less than a stick of butter – can be safely transported to different procedure and assessment rooms along with all their equipment, Children’s needs a replacement NICU shuttle. Children’s Hospital would like to purchase a new NICU shuttle, to replace a decommissioned model. This state-of-the-art shuttle makes it possible for an infant’s developmentally supportive “microenvironment” – comprised of incubators, ventilators, IV’s and more - to move with them. Vulnerable infants can be transported quickly and easily to assessments and procedures without fear of worsening their condition or experiencing loss of power to vital equipment.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(111, 114, 135);">YOUR IMPACT MATTERS</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(111, 114, 135);">Your contributions have already shown incredible results. Last year, your generosity helped us raise over $160,000 for essential medical equipment and furnishings for the maternity department at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza. This achievement was made possible by the dedication of over 4000 attendees across Canada who united to support Palestine's most vulnerable populations.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(111, 114, 135);">TOGETHER WE CAN ACHIEVE MORE</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(111, 114, 135);">With your continued support, we aim to strengthen healthcare systems, provide vital equipment, essential drugs, and offer capacity-building support to medical professionals. Your donations enable us to conduct in-person and online medical training, ensuring that care providers have the knowledge they need to save lives.</span></p><p><br></p>', '09:00:00', '18:30:00');
